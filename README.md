This is a demo project for using Apple Sign In and Biometric using Touch ID / Face ID using **SwiftUI**.

2. You need to log in with an Apple account in Xcode for the provisioning profile. If already login then ignore steps 3, 4, and 5.
3. After that, visit the Apple Developer account.
4. Go to Identifiers, then choose your bundle ID.
5. Check if Apple with Sign In is enabled or not.

After that, just follow the code.
